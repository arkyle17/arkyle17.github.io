    <br><center><img src="gradphoto.jpg" width="20%" id="border"></center><div id="Margin">
    <p class="indent">My name is Kyle Albernaz. I went to high school in a small Texas town where I grew up with my brothers and my mom, with a lot of the rest of my family living in Brazil. I went to the University of Texas at Austin where I received my Bachelor's Degree of Science in Chemistry in spring of 2017, along with a teaching certification for high school science completed in the fall of 2017 from the UTeach program at UT. I've always enjoyed teaching and seeing students understand a concept for the first time, and so naturally I decided that teaching was what I wanted to dedicate my life to. Throughout my life and definitely in college, I valued a quality education, and I began to see the gaps that arose in different communities when it came to obtaining that education. Because of this, I enjoy teaching in underserved districts and schools where I feel teachers are most needed.</p><br><p class="indent">At UT, I was involved in several research projects in biology, astronomy, physics, and chemistry, and though each was interesting in its own right, science research wasn't my calling, and teaching it was. Despite this, the interesting things I saw in hands-on experiments in these subjects inspires me to include reasearch and inquiry-driven projects in my own science classroom. In addition, as you can see in the Maker Showcase portion of my site, my personal teaching philosphy revolves around creativity in the sciences, something that many people don't associate despite, in my opinion, being very closely related. </p><br><p class="indent">In Fall of 2017, I student taught Pre-AP and On-Level chemistry at Connally High School under Loreni Kerecman in Pflugerville, Texas. Upon completion of student teaching, I was fortunate enough to continue teaching at Connally as a full time teacher after my cooperating teacher took a different job. I currently teach Pre-AP and On-Level chemistry.</p><br><p class="indent">I hope to use this site as a place to post things relevant to my career, such as my projects in making or assignments for my future classes. Thanks for giving my short bio a read!</p><br><br></div>
